In today's fast-paced world, travellers face a plethora of choices when planning their trips, from selecting destinations to arranging accommodations and activities. Navigating through these options can be overwhelming and time-consuming, often leading to suboptimal travel experiences. To address this challenge, I have come up with an idea of Fun Voyage, an android application that  aims to develop a comprehensive Travel Recommendation and Planner System that leverages technology to streamline the travel planning process and provide personalized recommendations tailored to individual preferences and constraints.
